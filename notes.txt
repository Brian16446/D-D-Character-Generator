Features that I would like to add.
Bugs/things that can make it better/optimized.

- Will add option to exclude the expansion pack stuff.
    - i.e button with SCAG, this will remove SCAG races/subclasses from the generator.
    - Will be a few buttons so that user can remove all/none/some depending on preferences.
    - Many people won't own all of the expansion books or have access to the info while playing.
    - I haven't added any of them in yet. When I figure out a way of selecting them, that's when I'll
      add them in.

- I think I could reduce the number of functions if I had 1 function that took in a file as an argument
and then searched the file and returned a word from it. Instead of having multiple functions to search
multiple files. Could likely be condensed into one function. Will look to update this after it all works
fine first.


- To style I will create a HTML file that mimics the php one just to practice
styling it so I don't break anything.


- I decided against sorting the arrays for stats and having a proper stat priority.
  I might include the option at the end to specify whether to weight the stats or not
  could make for a funnier game if stats are truly random.


- Would be nice if the CSS could have it so the container is centered to 80% width.

- Add a event so that when enter key is pressed it creates new character

- Will need to add a few sections to split up the stats maybe. So they're not just in a lame looking list
  - Will do this at the end.


- Might want to add a way of putting a + infront of the modifiers bit?

- Move the button to bottom of screen and add a title at the top

- Could unpack the stats/modifier arrays into variables for clarity?
